### SDL2_Game_Engine
<i>A first attempt to make a functional and easy to use 2D game engine for C++ with the SDL2 library.</i>

This is my first attempt to make a 2D game engine in C++ using the SDL2 library to handle rendering, sounds, input, etc. This engine is heavily inspired by the engine that we created in SoftUni during the Applications Development with C++ course 2021 with lecturer Zhivko Petrov.

I am sure there are possibilities for improvement in order to make it more robust and safer but as a first attempt I am quite content. I am open to criticism and ideas for improvement as it is currently in a state of perpetual improvement and development.

This code is free to use but please give credit. Thanks for reading and using my creation if you did.
